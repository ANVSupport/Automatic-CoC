# SafeGuard-CoC
Automatically preform Most of the CoC checks for SafeGuard Installations.. 
Some of them have to be preformed manually for now
To run the script first clone the repo, then run 
```shellscript
python3 main.py
```
Feature Roadmap:
- Integration with Safeguard-installer script
- create bash file that installs Python and calls the script
- prompt user to preform manual checks and log into the report
- make the app list call from a json file (instead of a hard coded dict)
